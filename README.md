This repository contains the code for ["An Interactive Decision-Support Dashboard for Optimal Hospital Capacity Management"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15634).

This code was adapted from the original codebase created for the Johns Hopkins Health System. All code and data specific to their hospital system has been removed.

To run the server, first install Julia and install the required packages in `Project.toml`. Then run:
```
./bin/server
```

See `data/README.md` for information about what data is required to run the server.
